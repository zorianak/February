<h1>Kim</h1>
<h2>Design Specialist</h2>
</div>

<div class="grid_8 frontpost">
<h4>Freelance designer. Cheesecake afficionado.</h4>
<p>While in high school, just before graduation, Kim began to learn this thing called the Internet.  She'd worked on it before - she remembers when table-based layouts were the way to go, and when design was a simple thing.  Now, she's got years of experience under her belt, and is building a portfolio charged with logos, poster illustration, graphics, and of course, website design. Want great work with thought put in it?  Then you want some of Kim's designs.</p>

<h2>QA Developer</h2>
</div>

<div class="grid_8 frontpost">
<h4>Gifted developer. Quality tester.</h4>
<p>With years of programming experience under her belt, Dre's the person that work goes to when it needs a spice of more intense development. Kim often sends her designs to see their weaknesses, make sure everything's implemented up to specs, and as a general annoyance.  Dre's site can be found at <a href="http://andreanall.com" target="_blank">AndreaNall.com</a>.</p>

<h1>Sam</h1>
<h2>Content Slave</h2>
</div>

<div class="grid_8 frontpost">
<h4>Content writer. Content editor.</h4>
<p>Ever wonder how someone could possibly hold a career doing nothing but writing site content?  It certainly takes a very amazing person - and that's our Sam. While we're sure he's fallen asleep a few times trying to plod through the next one thousand words, his writing voice will draw your clients in - and make them want more!  Talk about a job that requires passion - and in this case, gets more enthusiasm any sane person would get it. Sam'll either crank you out pages of original content, or take the content you submit and read it over to see how it can be tightened and deliver the message you want - and the one that your customers need.</p>
